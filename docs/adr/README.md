# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for this platform.

ADRs document significant decisions, their context, and rationale.
They are immutable once accepted — if a decision changes, a new ADR supersedes it.

## Format

Each ADR follows this structure:
- **Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Superseded by ADR-XXX
- **Context**: What situation prompted this decision?
- **Decision**: What was decided?
- **Consequences**: What are the trade-offs?

## Index

| [ADR-002](ADR-002-module-structure.md) | Module Structure Convention | Accepted |
